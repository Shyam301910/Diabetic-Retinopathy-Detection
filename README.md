# Introduction
A major side effect of diabetes called diabetic retinopathy can result in blindness and vision loss. High blood sugar levels in diabetics can harm the tiny blood vessels of the retina, causing them to hemorrhage or leak fluid. This may trigger the development of new blood vessels, which may then leak and result in the formation of scar tissue in the retina. If unchecked, these alterations can impair vision and result in blindness. Vision that is hazy or distorted, floaters, difficulties seeing at night, and a decline in color vision are all signs of diabetic retinopathy. It's crucial for persons with diabetes to get routine eye exams to look for any signs of diabetic retinopathy because in the early stages there may be no symptoms at all. 
Laser therapy or surgery may be used as diabetic retinopathy treatments to inhibit the development of new blood vessels or to remove blood or scar tissue from the eye. The development of diabetic retinopathy can be prevented or slowed down by maintaining strict management of blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
The early detection and precise diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy are two major management issues. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant consequence of diabetes that, if ignored, can result in blindness. It is primarily used for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of DR. The blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye, are damaged as a result of DR. According to estimates, roughly one-third of persons with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy to some extent, and the risk rises with the duration of diabetes. By taking pictures of the retina, medical imaging technologies like fundus photography are frequently used to identify diabetic retinopathy. However, skilled professionals must manually analyze these photos, which takes time and may be vulnerable to inter-observer variability. 
Automating the analysis of fundus pictures for the identification and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy can benefit greatly from image processing techniques. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to reliably detect diabetic retinopathy and gauge its severity by extracting features and patterns from the images. As a result, the visual loss caused by this disorder may be prevented or minimized by earlier detection and intervention. 

# Project-Objective
The goal of this project is to create and use image processing and machine learning algorithms to examine fundus images for the diagnosis and categorization of diabetic retinopathy. Pre-processing and feature extraction from the photos will be part of the research, along with training and assessing deep learning models for categorization. The model will predict the stage of the diabetic retinopathy from fundus retinal images. The stages can be one of the stages: - No Diabetic Retinopathy, Mild, Moderate, Severe and Proliferative. The project's ultimate goal is to develop a tool that will help medical practitioners diagnose and treat diabetic retinopathy, improving patient outcomes.

# Dataset
A dataset of 5590 retinal fundus images is used, of which 3662 photos are used to train the model and 1928 images are used to test the methods that were described in order to improve visualisation.
Most diabetes cases fall into one of two categories. Both proliferative and non- proliferative diabetes exist. Based on the severity, non-proliferative diabetes is divided into many classes. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is made into a separate class from the other three severity levels of mild, moderate, and severe. The retinal pictures can also be categorised into one of the following 5 categories:
0 - No DR
1 – Mild
2 – Moderate
3 – Severe
4 - Proliferative DR
The advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, happens when the retina's damaged blood vessels start to develop abnormally. If unchecked, bleeding from these new blood vessels could damage the eye, impair vision, and even result in blindness.
